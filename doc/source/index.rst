Welcome to qiita's documentation!
=================================

Qiita (canonically pronounced cheetah) is a software package intended for
analysis and administration of multi-omics datasets.

Qiita provides a free and open platform for users to: Easily share and reuse
existing data-sets in the form of studies. Perform analyses and meta-analyses
(combinations and comparisons of multiple studies/data-sets) using published
and unpublished data that meet the standards as described by this
documentation.  Easily interface with the EBI repository for automated
deposition. Query and interact with Qiita data programmatically.

If you intend to use Qiita at the `central deployment
<http://qiita.ucsd.edu>`__ we recommend that you have a look at the file
